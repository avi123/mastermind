    <h1>Welcome to Mastermind!</h1>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <p>A pattern is hiding behind the five white squares. To win this game, you must guess the pattern.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pick a color in each column.</li>
        <li>Click "Submit."</li>
        <li>
            Results will appear to the right of your guess.
            <ul>
                <li>A red square means that one of your guesses is the right color in the right spot. (It will not show you which guess is correct; it will only show how many guesses were correct.)</li>
                <li>A white square means that you have the correct color, but in the wrong spot. (Like the red squares, it will not specify which guess earned the white square.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Continue to guess until you win. OR... After 12 incorrect guesses, the game is over because you are a giant loser.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>NOTES:</h2>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>There are three hints available. Use them wisely.</li>
        <li>Colors may repeat (once or more) in the pattern.</li>
        <li>Suggestion - Try five different colors for your first guess.</li>
    </ol>
